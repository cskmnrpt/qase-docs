# Get started with the Qase platform

\#Intro

Qase helps to manage test cases, track their execution status, and report defects.

We're going to learn about:

* Projects - A project is a collection of all testing artifacts
* Test suites -  A test suite is a collection of all test cases&#x20;
* Test cases - to store the details of our test
* Test runs -  to define which tests should be executed on a product build and track execution status
* Testing defects - based on the failed result of a test case
