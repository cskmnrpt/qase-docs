#Intro

Qase helps to manage test cases, track their execution status, and report defects. Here is what we need to get started:

  * Create a project that will contain all artifacts
  * Create a test suite with test cases to store the details of our test
  * Create a test run to define which tests should be executed on a product build and track execution status
  * Create a defect based on the failed result of a test case
