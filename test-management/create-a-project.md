What are projects in software testing?

Projects are workspaces to keep all software testing related to a specific application together. We're going to create an imaginary food order mobile application as an example.

##To create a project:

1. Open https://app.qase.io/ and log in. Next, the “Projects” page is shown

2. Click the “Create new project” button. A popup “Create New Project” is shown. Fill in your app name and description. Notice that the field “Project Code” is automatically filled in with the first letters from the project name. You can edit this code if needed. You can also select who gets access to the project: you can select “Public” if you would like all users to have access to the Project. Or you can select “Private” and decide which users have access to the Project. 

3. Click on the button “Create project”. As a result, the new project is created and its Test Repository page is shown

Now it’s time to add some test suites and test cases.
