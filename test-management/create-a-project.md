# Projects

### What are projects in software testing?

Projects are workspaces to keep all software testing related to a specific application together. We're going to create an imaginary food order mobile application as an example.

### Create a project

To get started, go to [https://app.qase.io/](https://app.qase.io/) and log in. Then, you'll see the "Projects" page.

To create a new project:

1. Click the "Create new project" button.
2. A popup window called "Create New Project" will appear. Enter your app name and description. The "Project Code" field will automatically be filled with the first letters of the project name, but you can change it if you want. You can also choose who has access to the project: select "Public" if you want everyone to have access, or "Private" if you want to choose who has access.
3. Click the "Create project" button. This will create the new project and take you to its Test Repository page.

Owners of a workspace can view all projects including private projects created by other users of the workspace.

After creating a project, you can control who can access and see it, and have more control over your project in settings.

_General:_ In this section, you can find and edit the same properties that you defined in the creation stage - Project Name, Project Code, Description, and Project access type.

_Repository:_ This section contains options pertaining to the Repository itself.

_Webhooks:_ In this section, you will find the webhooks that have been configured for this Project so far, or create a new webhook to connect Qase with another third-party solution you use.

_Test Run:_ Customize various requirements and automation for Test Runs. Choose which Test Case settings you want to have enabled and which ones are not necessary. To view a detailed list of all the fields available to you, click on the “All Fields” hyperlink which will redirect you to the “Fields” section of your project. Once new settings have been selected, hit "Update Settings" to apply changes.

_Archiving a project:_ After completing a project, you might want to hide it from plain view. It should still be accessible for reference, but shouldn't obstruct the view of the currently active projects. While in the Projects section, you can switch between viewing Active or Archived projects, or view them all at once.
