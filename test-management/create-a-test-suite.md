# Test Suite creation & management in Qase

A Test Suite acts like a folder where we store our test cases organized by sections and subsections. You can create several test suites. For example, Functional and Non-Functional test suites or anything else that should be treated as a separate group of tests.

**To create a test suite:**

1. On the page “Repository” click on the button “Create new suite” or click on “+ Suite” next to the search bar on the top
2. As a result, the popup “Create Suite” is shown. Fill in the suite name and optionally other fields. To create a test suite, click on the button “Create”
3. As a result, the repository now displays your newly created Test Suite

Now we can add test cases!
