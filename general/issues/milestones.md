# Milestones

### What is a milestone in software development?

A Milestone in Qase allows you to create a specific point in your release or development cycle that can be later used to attribute your [Test cases](https://docs.qase.io/general/get-started-with-the-qase-platform/test-cases), [Defects](https://docs.qase.io/general/get-started-with-the-qase-platform/defects) and [Test Runs](https://docs.qase.io/general/get-started-with-the-qase-platform/create-a-test-run). In other words, you can specify which release or version a Test Case, Defect or a Test Run "belongs" to, which sprint a Test Run has been executed during, or which sprint a Defect was discovered in.

To create a new milestone, navigate to "Milestones" section, and hit "Create milestone".

From here, give your milestones necessary attributes: a name, brief description, status (active or completed), and due date:

### Applying milestone

Now that a Milestone is created, you can select it to be applied when creating a new Test Case, Defect or Test Run, or edit the existing Test Cases, Defects, and Test Runs to be connected to this Milestone:



* Test Case:

* Test Run:

* Defect:

Once your milestone has been assigned to a test case or several test cases, you will see how many test cases it has been assigned to in the "Milestones" section:

You can also sort your Milestones by clicking an arrow next to a column's name:
