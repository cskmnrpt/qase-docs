Saved Queries can be used with the [QQL widget](dashboards.md#h_9644c6d14d).

QQL widget allows you to leverage advanced query searches, and pin frequently used or preferred QQL searches to your [_dashboards_](dashboards.md) to facilitate quicker and more comprehensive monitoring of testing activities.
