**Queries, based on** [**Qase Query Language**](https://docs.qase.io/general/analytics/queries-qql-qase-query-language)**, help you make analytical requests to get specific data from your Qase projects.**

You can save your frequently used queries for quick access in the future.

If you need to search using the same query in future, you can find this saved query in your [Query list](https://app.qase.io/report/queries-list).

When using a Saved Query, the original request is pasted into the field, and you can make changes. After modifying it, you can save it as a new query using "Save As" or update the existing one with the "Update" option.
