# Qase API

### What can I do with API?

Qase provides API methods that you can utilize to interact with it, set up custom integrations or create your own solutions to submit automated execution results into Qase test runs.

You can refer to full API documentation to learn more here: [https://developers.qase.io](https://developers.qase.io/)

Also, you can find a public collection on Postman which contains all available API methods: [https://www.postman.com/qaseio?tab=collections](https://www.postman.com/qaseio?tab=collections)
