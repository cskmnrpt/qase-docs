# Trash bin

If you have deleted a [test case](./), it will reside in trash bin located in the three-dots-menu:

From the trash bin, you can restore a previously deleted test case (either a singular case or in bulk):

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that only individual test cases can be restored from the Trash bin. If you’ve accidentally deleted a **`test suite`** containing multiple cases, the test cases can be recovered, but the suite itself must be recreated.
{% endhint %}

Recovered test cases without an associated suite will be moved to the root of the project under the label “Test cases without a suite.”
