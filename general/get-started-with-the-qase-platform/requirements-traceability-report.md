# Requirements Traceability Report

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JADVE-zbST0" %}

Understanding the relations between test cases and requirements is essential for ensuring the success of any project.

By analyzing this connection, teams can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their testing efforts and can make informed decisions to improve quality.

A Requirement Traceability Report provides insight into how each test case aligns with project requirements, allowing for better tracking and management of testing efforts.

## Overview <a href="#h_a07a39ba8a" id="h_a07a39ba8a"></a>

***

Requirement Traceability Report is a _snapshot_ of the relationship between your test cases and requirements from the external issue trackers like Jira.

At its core, the report provides insights into the _number of linked requirements_ and identifies any un-linked ones, providing you with a clear overview of the test coverage status.

Furthermore, it offers detailed insights for each linked requirement, showcasing the specific test cases associated with them, as well as the _testing status of each test case_.

If a test case has failed during a recent run, the report also _highlights any associated defects_, providing visibility into the defect status.

{% hint style="success" %}
The Report enables you to quickly assess the current state of testing for each requirement, identifying any failed tests and corresponding defect statuses, thus empowering teams to _prioritize and address critical issues effectively_.
{% endhint %}



**Tracking changes**

In addition to capturing a snapshot of testing status at a specific point in time, you have the flexibility to _generate new versions_ of the report, as needed.

This helps track changes in _test coverage, and execution status status over time_ providing a historical record of testing progress and improvements.

{% hint style="info" %}
Generate new versions to _compare_ different snapshots, _identify trends_, and _measure the impact_ of changes in testing efforts.
{% endhint %}
