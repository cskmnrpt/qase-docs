Qase SCIM API is used by SSO partners to provision, manage, and de-provision users.



The SCIM API is based on the Open standard: System for Cross-domain Identity Management 2. Our SCIM implementation uses the 2.0 version of the protocol.

**With SCIM, you can:**

Get all users in a company. Update, activate, or deactivate users.
