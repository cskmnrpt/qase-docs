Map the following parameters as shown in the screenshot above.

* SAML Sign-in URL: the URL copied from Step 4.
* Identity Provider Issuer: JumpCloud
* Key x509 Certificate: text from the `certificate.pem` that you have downloaded in Step 6.
*   Domains\*: provide a list of domains separated by a comma, that will be used for SSO. Public domains like Gmail, Hotmail, etc. are not allowed.\
    \
    \*_This step is mandatory._\


    `Any domains that are added will need to be verified. To do so, you will need to add a TXT record to the domain's DNS records`
