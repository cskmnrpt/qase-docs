# Groups

### What is a "Group" tab in Qase?

**Group** is a way to categorize your account users by the team they belong to, responsibilities, or team lead - in other words, by any arbitrary characteristic that you deem important.

After a User Group has been created, you will see it in the groups' list, together with its description and members' number. Under the three-dots menu button, you can View, Edit, or Delete a user group:

However, when you attempt to delete a User Group, you will be suggested to move all of its current members into a different User Group (if you have more than one). Alternatively, you can "Do Nothing" and go ahead with deletion:\

### Usage <a href="#h_cdd781ca0e" id="h_cdd781ca0e"></a>

After creating a user group, you can share a project wit ha group both when you [create a new project](https://docs.qase.io/general/get-started-with-the-qase-platform/create-a-project) and after a project has been created.

While creating a project, you will see the option to “add members from a specific group”. Once you select this option, you will see a dropdown list of the groups you’ve created. Select the one you would like to add to this project and proceed further.
