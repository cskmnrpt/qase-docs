# Attachments

### What are attachments in Qase?

Attachments in the workspace provide a comprehensive overview of the files that have been uploaded and attached to Qase. However, since attachment storage space is limited (500 MB for the Free plan, 250 GB for the startup plan, and unlimited storage for business and enterprise plans), it is important to monitor usage and free up space as needed.

In the attachments section, you will see a graph showing how much space you have used up so far out of the total available to you:

### Deleting attachments

Any file can be deleted from a three-dot-menu to the right, thus freeing up available space. Files are deleted permanently without any option to restore them at a later point.
