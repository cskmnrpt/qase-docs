{% hint style="success" %}
Qase is SOC 2 Type II compliant
{% endhint %}

The full SOC 2 Type II compliance report can be provided upon request, once we sign a mutual non-disclosure agreement between your company and Qase, as this report discloses sensitive information.&#x20;

:information\_source:  To request SOC 2 Type II compliance report and to proceed with mNDA, please send a message to [sales@qase.io](mailto:sales@qase.io)



SOC 3 report, on the other hand, is also a byproduct of SOC 2 Type II certification (as it cannot be obtained without going through SOC 2 Type II certification audit), however it's much more narrow in scope, discloses less information and we can provide it without having to sign any other agreements. You can find it attached below.
