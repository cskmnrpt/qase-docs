Make sure to provide all the correct details for SSO/SAML to work properly:

* SAML Sign-in URL
* Identity Provider Issuer
* Key x509 Certificate
* Domains (list of email domains that your users will be using to access Qase)

### What are additional security options?

Additional options available in "Security" are:

* _Default role:_ assign which user role should be granted to any new members joining the account.
* _Automatically add new users as read-only members:_ you can impose a safeguard making sure that anyone just joining an account will not be able to create something new or accidentally update or delete existing work.
* _Disable common login:_ with this option turned on, only users with an email address in your domain will be able to sign in.
