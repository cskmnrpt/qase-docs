# How do I get free trial access?

Qase provides a free 1-month trial for the startup and business subscriptions. To create a new account with trial access, simply navigate to the [pricing page](https://qase.io/pricing), choose the subscription you want to try, and hit "Start free trial":

If you have already been using a free account but haven't yet enabled a trial before, you can do so from your account's billing tab (you need to be the account owner for that). If you’re the account owner, here’s a direct link to the [billing section](https://app.qase.io/billing) where you can start the free trial by clicking the "Upgrade" button and choosing the parameters of the subscription you would like to trial.
