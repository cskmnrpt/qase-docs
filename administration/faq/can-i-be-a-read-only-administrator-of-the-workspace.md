# Can I be a read-only administrator of the workspace?

In Qase, the type of license is always stronger than the role. You can have an administrator role but be a read-only type/user: you will be read-only first, it will supersede the administrator role.

So if you have an administrator role but are a billing user/type, you will not be able to access the rights of the administrator role but only that of a billing type/user.
