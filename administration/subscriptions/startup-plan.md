# Startup plan

### When to choose a startup plan?

The full-featured startup plan helps organize collaboration within distributed teams of _more than three people_ and provides access to the following capabilities:

* Core features (test case management, shared steps, milestones, test plans and runs, defects).
* 250 Gb storage for attachments
* [API](https://developers.qase.io/reference/introduction-to-the-qase-api) and Webhooks
* Custom fields for test cases, test runs, and defects
* Dashboards
* Requirements

There is a minimum number of 3 seats. To upgrade or downgrade your current plan to a startup plan, you need access to a "Billing" role in your workspace.

The startup plan has a tiered pricing model and depends on the number of active users in your team:

| <p># users</p><p>Active users in a team</p> | <p>Monthly price</p><p>per user, Monthly billing</p> | Monthly price per user, Annual billing |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 3-20 users                                  | $24                                                  | $20                                    |
