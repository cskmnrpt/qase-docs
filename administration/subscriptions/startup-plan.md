# Startup plan

### When to choose a startup plan?

The full-featured startup plan helps organize collaboration within distributed teams of _more than three people_ and provides access to the following capabilities:

* Core features (test case management, shared steps, milestones, test plans and runs, defects).
* 250 Gb storage for attachments
* [API](https://developers.qase.io/reference/introduction-to-the-qase-api) and Webhooks
* Custom fields for test cases, test runs, and defects
* Dashboards
* Requirements

There is a minimum number of 3 seats. To upgrade or downgrade your current plan to a startup plan, you need access to a "Billing" role in your workspace.

The startup plan has a tiered pricing model and depends on the number of active users in your team:

| <p># users</p><p>Active users in a team</p> | <p>Monthly price</p><p>per user per month</p> | <p>Annual price</p><p>per user per year</p> |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| From 3 to 5 users                           | 24$                                           | 240$                                        |
| From 6 to 10 users                          | 22$                                           | 220$                                        |
| From 11 to 20 users                         | 21$                                           | 210$                                        |
