# Startup plan

### When to choose a startup plan?

The full-featured startup plan helps organize collaboration within distributed teams of _more than three people_ and provides access to the following capabilities:

* Core features (test case management, shared steps, milestones, test plans and runs, defects).
* 100 GB storage for [attachments](../workspace-management/attachments.md)
* [API](https://developers.qase.io/reference/introduction-to-the-qase-api) and [Webhooks](../../general/webhooks/)
* [Custom fields](../workspace-management/custom-fields.md) for test cases, test runs, and defects
* Ready only users
* [Dashboards](../../general/analytics/dashboards.md)
* [Requirements](../../general/issues/requirements.md)

There is a minimum number of 3 seats.&#x20;

To upgrade or downgrade your current plan to a Startup plan, you need to have an "Owner" or "Administrator" role in your Workspace. Or, [schedule a quick call](https://calendly.com/d/2hk-f9q-5h5/qase-upgrade-discussion) with a member of our team to confirm the correct configuration for your Workspace.
