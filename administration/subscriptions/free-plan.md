### When to choose a free plan?

The free plan is good for single quality assurance engineers and small companies, and provides access to the following:

* Up to 3 regular users in a team
* Unlimited read-only users :warning:
* 2 concurrent test runs&#x20;
* 500Mb for attachments
* Defect management
* Shared steps
* [API](https://developers.qase.io/reference/introduction-to-the-qase-api) :warning:
* Apps :warning:
* Community Support

There is a maximum number of 3 Regular users on the free plan, and an unlimited number of Read-only users on any of the free or paid plans.

To upgrade your Workspace to a paid plan, you need to have access to a "Billing" role in your workspace.

The Startup & Business plans have a tiered pricing model, which depends on the number of active users in your team.
