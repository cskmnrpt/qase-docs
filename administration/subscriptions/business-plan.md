# Business plan

### When to choose a business plan?

The Business plan is the best starting point for teams 5+ that need extra flexibility on the user management side:

* All features from startup plan
* Up to 100 users per team
* Unlimited storage for attachments
* Unlimited free read-only users
* Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
* Test case review
* Queries (QQL, Qase Query Language)
* Premium support

There is a minimum number of 5 seats. To upgrade or downgrade your current plan to a business plan, you need to have access right "Billing" in the role.

The business plan has a tiered pricing model and depends on the number of active users in your team:

| <p># users</p><p>Active users in a team</p> | <p>Monthly price</p><p>per user, Monthly billing</p> | Monthly price per user, Annual billing |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 5-100 users                                 | $36                                                  | $30                                    |
