# Billing

### What is the billing section for?

The billing section of the workspace allows managing the subscription and obtaining the issued invoices. This section is only accessible to the workspace owner, billing users, or those that have specific permission to access "Billing" in their [custom role](../workspace-management/roles.md).

### How to check my current billing plan?

On the Subscription page, you can view your current plan, upgrade options, the number of active users, and the next charge.

Additionally, you can invite new users to Qase, update the subscription, and change the payment method.
