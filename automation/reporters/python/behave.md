# Behave

### What is Behave?

Behave is a popular behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for Python. It is used to write and execute tests in a natural language style (Gherkin syntax), which is easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. This makes it a powerful tool for collaboration between developers, testers, and business analysts in the software development process.
