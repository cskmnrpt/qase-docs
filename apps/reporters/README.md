### How to pass the results of the automated executions into Qase for full coverage?

It is likely that you and your QA team has given a thought to automating some parts of your testing - or, perhaps, you already have automated testing implemented. And you might be wondering if there's any way to pass the results of the automated executions into Qase for full coverage.

The answer is yes!

We provide open-source tools that allow you to send the results of automated executions into your Qase test runs.

You can find all of the available API reporters in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/qase-tms).
