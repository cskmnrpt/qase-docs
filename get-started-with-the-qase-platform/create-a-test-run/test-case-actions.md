# Test Case Actions

### What can I do with a test case? <a href="#h_d0eea20146" id="h_d0eea20146"></a>

Once you have filled in all the information about your Test Case, you can either:

* [_Send to review_](https://help.qase.io/en/articles/5563713-test-case-review)_:_ in this case, a new Test Case Review request will be created, and a person responsible for reviews will then give their decision on a submitted Test Case.
* _Save your Test Case_
* _Save and create another_
* _Cancel:_ exit Test Case creation; your changes will not be saved.

### What else?

After saving the Test Case, it will appear in your Repository structure along with other Test Suites and Cases, and will be assigned a code like "MR-5" (where "MR" is the project code and "5" is the case number).

If you click on a Test Case in the Repository view, a Summary Bar will appear on the right side of the screen, showing the Test Case properties and options to Edit, Clone, or Delete it.

If you delete a Test Case, it will be moved to the Trash Bin accessible from the three-dots menu. You can restore a previously deleted Test Case from the Trash Bin.
