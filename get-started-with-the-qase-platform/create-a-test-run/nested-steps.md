# Nested Steps

### What are nested steps in software testing?

This is a list of sub-steps that you need to perform within a step. This step has a parent-child relationship and is a sub-step of another step.

**Using nested steps**

1. To use a nested step, click on the three-dot menu of a step and select "Add child step."
2. If you have steps that apply to multiple test cases in a project and have matching properties throughout, you can save time by creating [Shared Steps](https://help.qase.io/en/articles/5563709-shared-steps). Once you have at least one Shared Step created in the "Shared Steps" view of your project, you can select "+ Add Shared Step" when creating or editing a test case.

When configuring a case step, you can customize it using the buttons beside the "Expected result" field:

1. You can attach files from your existing files in Qase or from your computer.
2. You can duplicate/clone a step.
3. You can create a Shared Step.
4. You can add a step.
5. You can add a nested step.
6. You can delete a step.
